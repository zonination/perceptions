# Perceptions of Probability and Numbers

[This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3hi7ul/oc_what_someone_interprets_when_you_say_probably/) made the Longlist for the 2015 Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards: [Link](http://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/818-perceptions-of-probability)

## About

These are a couple of polls inspired by the Sherman Kent CIA study shown in the images below (discussion in [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3gmj6h/probable_is_a_vague_word_but_this_image_helps_ive/ctzgwhm)). I was super happy when they matched up.

The raw data came from /r/samplesize responses to the following question: *What [probability/number] would you assign to the phrase "[phrase]"?* I have the raw CSV data from the poll in this repository.
